# lookOP
There are no special requirements for this project.
Everything is written in python using libraries which are already included in the Python installation (TKinter).
We use the PorterStemmer introduced in our class.

To run the code, simply clone this project and place the CSV input files in the same folder as the "indexer.py".
The input CSV are available at: http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip (link from http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/)
